# Analysis

## Layer 2, Head 5

In this head, tokens appear to focus on their corresponding determiners. For instance, nouns frequently attend to the "the," "a," or "an" that precedes them. This suggests that this head might be useful for identifying noun phrases or for distinguishing between specific and non-specific entities.

Example Sentences:
- The **cat** sat on the mat.
- An **apple** a day keeps the doctor away.

## Layer 7, Head 8

This head seems to focus on coordinating conjunctions and the words they connect. When a conjunction like "and" or "but" is present, the attention appears to link the conjunction with both of the phrases or clauses it connects. This could indicate a role in understanding compound structures or the logical relationships between clauses.

Example Sentences:
- She bought apples **and** oranges.
- He wanted to go for a walk **but** it started raining.
